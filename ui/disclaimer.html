        <h3>Your Health Comes First:</h3>
        By using JackedGPT.ai, you're acknowledging that while we offer tons of
        helpful information, none of it should replace professional medical
        advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Seriously, your health is top priority,
        so always consult with a qualified healthcare provider for any medical
        concerns.

        <h3>Understanding the Risks:</h3>
        We're all about getting stronger and healthier here, but it's important
        to recognize that some of the activities showcased on this site come
        with risks. Think things like heart issues, bone and joint injuries, or
        even serious spinal mishaps. We're not trying to scare you off, just
        want you to be fully aware of what you're getting into.
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>You're in Control:</h3>
        When you use JackedgPT.ai, you're doing so voluntarily, fully
        acknowledging and accepting any risks involved. Whether it's a pulled
        muscle or a more serious situation, you're taking responsibility for
        your own safety.
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Our Liability (or Lack Thereof):</h3>
        JackedGPT.ai and its crew aren't liable for any injuries, property
        damage, or even worse outcomes that might happen while you're using the
        site. It's not that we don't care—we're just covering our bases here.
        So, please be careful out there!
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Legal Mumbo Jumbo:</h3>

        owners, and associates aren't on the hook for any legal stuff that might
        come up. We're all about transparency and keeping things fair. Alright,

        and reach those fitness goals together!
